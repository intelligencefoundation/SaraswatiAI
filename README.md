## All of Education, for All

### Humanitarian AI : Superhuman Teacher 

ALL OF EDUCATION, FOR ALL. For the purpose of achieving all of education for all, the [Intelligence Foundation Charity](http://www.intelligence.tv/), in collaboration with [Montreal.AI](http://www.montreal.ai), is developing a teacher, *Saraswati AI*, and an agent learning to orchestrate synergies, *Polymatheia AI*.

"*(…) in full and equal opportunities for education for all (…)*" - Preamble to UNESCO’s Constitution

*Saraswati AI* is a novel, collaborative and open humanitarian AI project developed by the people,for the people.

### Impact of the contribution

Expected Beneficiaries: 100 million people.

__This humanitarian AI project will be developed by the people, for the people.__ 

In order to inspire, support and train the people who will shape the 21st Century, the Intelligence Foundation is preparing to offer academic training and conferences, prizes and recognitions and open research and publications.

### Technology

* Curriculum Learning
* DeepLearning
* MetaLearning
* OpenAI Gym
* Neuroevolution
* Reinforcement Learning
* Self-Attention
* Self-Supervised Learning
* Symbolic AI (*MCTS*)
* Transformers

#### Preliminary Considerations

* Objective function design: Directly optimize for what we want.
* Usage of functions which modify the target density to enable aggressive data augmentations.
* Searching and Learning in the knowledge space with MCTS and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
